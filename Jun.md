Jun Hong

My name is Jun and I'm a 3rd year majoring in CS. I'm not entirely sure on having ideas for the project yet but there is the opportunity to think of extra features to add as progress is made.

Team NORMS: I think setting soft deadlines for certain parts of the project would be helpful for the progression of the project.
